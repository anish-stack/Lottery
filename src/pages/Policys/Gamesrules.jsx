                How to Play
                Every purchase of a bottled dream unlocks your chance to turn ordinary days into extraordinary ones with two electrifing draw games – Fortune 5 and Super 6. So, grab your bottle, pick your numbers, and prepare to witness the magic of possibility unfold!

                1. We offer two sizes, two games, and two paths to your dream life. Opt for a 250-ml bottle for AED 10 to embark on the fulfilling quest of Fortune 5, or choose the 500-ml bottle for AED 30 and unlock the potential of Super 6. Each bottle is your passport to thrilling draws and, potentially, a life-altering jackpot.

                2. Your ticket is your key to a brighter future. Select 5 numbers from 1 to 36 for Fortune 5 or choose 6 numbers from 1 to 49 for Super 6. Every number holds the power to be your lucky strike, so choose wisely and let intuition guide your hand.

                3. Weekly Draw Dates are mentioned on the ticket you purchase. Every Friday, witness the Fortune 5 live draw on Social Channels and see if you have chosen the right numbers on your ticket. On Saturday, it's time for the Super 6 grand finale, where your selected six numbers could unlock a life-changing fortune. Tune in, hold your breath, and watch your dreams turn into reality.
